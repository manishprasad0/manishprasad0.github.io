Hello! I am Manish Prasad. I am an incoming MSc Physics student at ETH Zürich, passionate about physics and astronomy.

<!---
I am particularly interested in the popularization and democratization of statistics (and its applications in R) in order to make them accessible to everyone.

As I enjoy sharing my skills with others, I am [teaching](/teaching/) assistant for several courses in statistics, probability and data science. I also help professionals and companies to [analyze their data](https://datanalyze.be/), and I give [private lessons](https://easystat.be/) to students and researchers. This is in parallel with my [research](/research/), which constitutes the core of my PhD thesis.

When I find the time, I [code](/software/) in R and share it on my [blog](https://statsandr.com/).
