## FDTD Simulations Using GPR Max

I did an internship at the Space Applications Center, Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) on "FDTD Simulations Using GPRMax" from August 2021 to October 2021. Since this was during the pandemic, the intership was conducted online.

### Abstract

The Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method is an approach to the numerical solution of Maxwell’s equations. You discretize both the space and time continua and solve for the electromagnetic fields using boundary conditions through Maxwell's equations. The building block of this discretized FDTD grid is the Yee cell named after Kane Yee who pioneered the FDTD method. With finer discretization, we get more accurate results. But the computational power required increases.

This method is useful for many applications. For example, determining the constituents and distribution of materials underground at some spot. This can be done through a ground-penetrating radar (GPR), which is a geophysical method that uses radar pulses to image the subsurface. And GPRMax is a free tool to do the same. It is a computer programme that implements the FDTD method for GPR modelling. Some of its features are: an easy to use command interface, the ability to model dispersive materials, the modelling of complex shaped targets as well as the simulation of unbounded space using powerful absorbing boundary conditions. My intership was on using GPRMax for calculating the sub-surface constituents and distribution of materials in Lunar soil models. You can find more about GPRMax [here](https://docs.gprmax.com/en/latest/index.html).

I learned a lot from this internship. Like the technical stuff about simulations using the FDTD method, the physics of radars and GPRs, using GPR Max. And I also really value the non-technical things I learned from this. This internship coincided with my 7th semester at IITR and I had to really manage my time properly. I successfully balanced the internship, work for my thesis, and got top grades in my college courses. And other things like writing proper and timely reports, being professional, and being punctual with deadlines. Overall, it was a fantastic opportunity because I got to explore computational and engineering-based work at ISRO with a team of highly skilled and knowledgeable scientists.
