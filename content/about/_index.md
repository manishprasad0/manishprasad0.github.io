I am an incoming Master in Physics student at ETH ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. I did my Bachelor in Engineering Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (IITR), India. When I was nine years old, I watched the excellent documentary: Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking and was instantly captivated by the bizarreness of black holes and the origin of the universe. After that day, there has been nothing that has piqued my curiosity more than physics. My research interests include gravitational physics, cosmology, and high-energy physics. I aim to delve deeper into these domains and decide on the specific area in which I wish to pursue my Ph.D.

I have worked on multiple projects on physics and applied physics.
- **Bachelor's Thesis Project on Applications of Q-statistics in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, at IITR**: We studied the effects of modifying Maxwell's distribution using Tsallis non-extensive statistics (q-statistics) to calculate the primordial abundances of light elements during big bang nucleosynthesis
- **Internship on FDTD Simulations Using GPRMax, at the Space Applications Center ISRO**: We used the finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) method to calculate the electromagnetic fields of reflected rays and implemented the code for the ground penetrating radar using GPRMax.

I am also deeply passionate about teaching and science communication. I feel a great sense of jubilation when people get the eureka moment of understanding something after I explain it to them.
- **Teaching Assistant**: I was a teaching assistant for the course Electrodynamic Theory at IITR. I led tutorial classes, graded
assignments, and provided one-to-one tutoring.
- **Student Mentor**: I was also an Institute Student Mentor at IITR for first-year physics students. I guided them regarding academics, their new life in hostels, projects, campus groups, etc. 
- **Summer of Math Exposition**: I participated in 3Blue1Brown's Summer of Math Exposition 2. I made a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/2-iuxnpJFKU) about a math problem with a very elegant geometric solution.

In parallel to my academics at IITR, I was an Executive Editor at WatchOut (the official student media body of IITR), a guitarist in the Music Section, and an Executive Member of the Physics and Astronomy Club IITR. See more in my [CV](/cv/). 

I enjoy playing my guitar, playing chess (I am around 1600 ELO on chess.com), and creating art. In my spare time, I also like to write [blogs](/blog/) about things I find interesting.
