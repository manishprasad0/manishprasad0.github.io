I did my Bachelor in Engineering Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (IITR), India. When I was nine years old, I watched the excellent documentary: Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking and was instantly captivated by the bizarreness of black holes and the origin of the universe. After that day, there has been nothing that has piqued my curiosity more than physics. My research interests include gravitational physics, cosmology, and high-energy physics. I aim to delve deeper into these domains and decide on the specific area in which I wish to pursue my Ph.D.\nI have worked on multiple projects on physics and applied physics.\nBachelor\u0026rsquo;s Thesis Project on Applications of Q-statistics in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, at IITR: We studied the effects of modifying Maxwell\u0026rsquo;s distribution using Tsallis non-extensive statistics (q-statistics) to calculate the primordial abundances of light elements during big bang nucleosynthesis Internship on FDTD Simulations Using GPRMax, at the Space Applications Center ISRO: We used the finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) method to calculate the electromagnetic fields of reflected rays and implemented the code for the ground penetrating radar using GPRMax. I am also deeply passionate about teaching and science communication.

I am not an expert at hugo. This website is my first proper web development project. But I hope to teach you everything I learnt while creating this specific personal/research/blog website. I am not writing out all the exact instructions here. But I have linked all the websites and tutorials I have used to create my website. I hope this saves your time (because I had to watch a lot of pointless tutorials). Also, if this is your first website project, don\u0026rsquo;t be intimidated by this. It can be pretty painful initially, but after setting up everything, you only need to add stuff to your page.\nInstalling Hugo and Git #\rHugo Check the latest released version here: Hugo Releases There is an excellent playlist on YouTube by Mike Dane called Hugo - Static Site Generator | Tutorial. For installing Hugo on windows, watch Tutorial 2. Make sure to do the \u0026ldquo;Modify path variable step\u0026rdquo; given in the tutorial. Git Download for Windows. I downloaded \u0026ldquo;64-bit Git for Windows Setup\u0026rdquo; Why the Theme Congo? #\rThere are a bunch of Themes on Hugo you can choose from. I chose Congo because I really liked the style.\nCongo is a simple, elegant, and powerful theme and has a lot of documentation. You can find almost everything you\u0026rsquo;ll need here.\nIt supports things like \\(\\LaTeX\\) using \\(\\KaTeX\\) (Documentation for \\(\\KaTeX\\)). This was important for me since I need it for posts about my research. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if this is easy to implement on websites, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want bother. I like the convenience of congo.\nFor documentation about \\(\\LaTeX\\), see Mathematical Noatation and Shortcodes. To write stuff in \\(\\LaTeX\\), simply write {{\u0026lt; katex \u0026gt;}} at the top of the page (or anywhere for that matter). Use the following syntax:\n{{\u0026lt; katex \u0026gt;}} % This has to be written, but can be written anywhere within the document\r\\\\(\\LaTeX\\\\) % This is the same are writing things enclosed by $ $ in LaTeX\r\\\\(f(a,b,c) = (a^2+b^2+c^2)^3\\\\) $$G_{\\mu\\nu} = 8\\pi G T_{\\mu\\nu}$$ % This produces an equation aligned at the center Output:\n\\(f(a,b,c) = (a^2+b^2+c^2)^3\\) $$G_{\\mu\\nu} = 8\\pi GT_{\\mu\\nu}$$\nCreating your website project #\rTo use the theme Congo, after downloading Hugo, follow the instructions in Congo Installation Watch Tutorial 4 to understand what each folder means. For a general set of instructions, check out Hugo quickstart. The step called Set up theme configuration files might feel weird because you are deleting the config.toml file, but you have to do it this way. Before I go into the specifics of creating a website like this, I want to give you a few tips for using VS Code. This might be obvious to a lot of you, but I want to share them anyway. General Tips for VS Code #\rPress Ctrl + Shift + v to open a preview of the markdown page. Then drag that window to the right to open it. Now you can preview the website in real-time without starting the hugo server. Also, VS Code synchronizes the markdown file and the preview. If you scroll on the markdown file, the preview page also scrolls accordingly.\nIf you have multiple markdown files open and a preview page open to the right side, you can press Ctrl + Tab to switch between the different markdown files and the preview will automatically change to the preview of the new markdown file.\nTo get more more screen space, press Ctrl + b to hide the file explorer. You can also close the terminal for now using Ctrl + `. Just open it (using the same shortcut) when you want to create a new file or to start/stop the hugo server.\nTips for Creating the Website #\rThe amazing thing about Congo is that the documentation has everything. Just follow the steps in Getting Started\nTo get your homepage like mine, Go to the params.toml file and change layout = \u0026lsquo;profile\u0026rsquo;.\nThe most important folder for you is the content folder. A very nice explanation is given in Tutorial 6.\nCreate a _index.md file in the content folder. You can do this in the terminal by typing\nhugo new _index.md You don\u0026rsquo;t have to write hugo new content/_index.md as it is already understood by hugo that _index.md should be made inside the content folder. But if you want to make an _index.md file inside a folder in the content folder, then you have to specify the path. See the CV section later in this blog.\nThe stuff you write in this _index.md file is what is going to be displayed on the page. For example, the code for my homepage is written in the _index.md file in the content folder (content/_index.md). The stuff on my CV page is written in the _index.md file inside the content/cv folder (content/cv/_index.md).\nThe best reference page is the exampleSite on the Congo github. I understood so much about the layout of congo from the content folder over there because guess what, this content folder contains all the markdown files for the actual congo website. (Except for one thing which I have discussed later)\nSay you want to learn how make a website similar to the Users page. Well now you can go to Users page on Github and see all the additions you need to make!\nIf you are feeling lazy, you can just copy the code from my github too. I have also copied code from other congo users. Other people\u0026rsquo;s code is actually a great source to learn from.\nHave a look at how other people have organized everything in the content folder. Look at the things they have written in the _index.md files, and the other markdown files and compare it with the actual website. This helped me out a lot.\nIf you ever need to write html code for something and don\u0026rsquo;t want to google the syntax, an easy method is use a markdown to html website (or ChatGPT)\nSome weird things about Hugo and Congo #\rHugo Pluralizes Titles\nOn my website, I have a page called \u0026lsquo;Research\u0026rsquo; which you can find in the menu at the top. When I first clicked on it, the title of that page was \u0026lsquo;Researches\u0026rsquo;. Like any other programmer, you first assume that you did something wrong, and not the actual software. It took me a long time to think that maybe hugo is messing this up somehow. Thankfully, I found this Stackoverflow question. Yes, for some weird reason, Hugo pluralizes titles. To fix this, go to the config.toml file and type: pluralizelisttitles = false Congo Article Thumbnails\nSay you want to learn how to display your articles on your blog page the same way congo has done for their Samples page with thumbnails. As I mentioned before, I went to the Samples page on Github and added a jpg file in the correct location, the same way they have done. And guess what, the thumbnails didn\u0026rsquo;t appear.\nThis one is pretty stupid because I was not able to find anything about it in the documentation. After searching this issue on the congo discussions page, I found this comment by jpanther, the creator of Congo. Turns out, the name of that jpg file must have the word thumb at the beginning.\nTips for making my CV page #\rTo get the button at the top, check out Button Documentation.\n{{/* button href=\u0026#34;/cv.pdf\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_self\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}\rDownload CV\r{{\u0026lt; /button \u0026gt;}} The biggest problem I faced when I made this CV website was aligning parts of the same line to left and right. For example, look at this line:\nBachelor of Technology - Engineering Physics2018 - 2022\nI wanted the years to be written nicely to the right side. But apparently, there is no simple way to do this. Markdown does not have a function like \\hfill in \\(\\LaTeX\\). And of course, \\(\\KaTeX\\) does not support only this one space-fill function of \\hfill, yet. For me, the best way to tackle this was to write an html code for this:\n\u0026lt;p style=\u0026#34;text-align:left;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;h3 id=\u0026#34;bachelor-of-technology-engineering-physics\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Bachelor of Technology - Engineering Physics\r\u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;float:right;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\r2018 - 2022\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; Yes. I wrote this ugly html code everywhere in my CV page. Please help me if you of a more elegant method to do this.\n","date":"28 March 2023","permalink":"manishprasad0.github.io/blog/website-with-hugo/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Tips for creating a website the Congo theme on Hugo","title":"Website with Hugo"},{"content":"\rAbstract #\rIn this project, we used the framework of Tsallis non-extensive statistics (q-statistics) to modify the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution of nucleons to calculate the primordial abundances of light elements during big bang nucleosynthesis. Using the best-fit curves of the S-factor as a function of temperature for 12 primary reactions in the reaction network, we calculated the new reaction rates using the non-extensive Tsallis framework. The abundances of light nuclei were computed using a BBN code, and the impact of this q-parameter and the drawbacks of this model were discussed. By adding a non-extensive parameter (q), the abundances of primordial abundances of light nuclei were in better agreement with the observed values. The predictions can be improved by using a more vast code that includes additional reactions along with their reverse reaction rates, where all the rates are calculated in the Tsallis framework. But even with the limitations of this project, we observed that the abundances of elements like Lithium were better predicted in this non-extensive framework.\nA Brief Description #\rBig-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) describes the production of the lightest nuclides, such as elements like H, He, Li, and Be, during the first seconds of cosmic time. But, the current theory overestimates the abundance of 7Li. The generally accepted prediction for Lithium abundance is \\( ^{7}Li/H = (4.68 \\pm 0.67)10^{-10} \\), which is about three times greater than the widely accepted central value of observations, \\( ^{7}Li/H = (1.58 \\pm 0.30)10^{-10} \\). And Tsallis\u0026rsquo;s statistics can be helpful in solving this.\nThe idea is to use a generalized version of the Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution to estimate these abundances. The concept was introduced in 1988 by Constantino Tsallis as a basis for generalizing the standard statistical mechanics.\nThe Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution for one particle is given by: $$ f_{MB}(v)=\\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_{B}T}\\right)^{3/2}exp\\left(-E/k_{B}T\\right) $$ And the Tsallis distribution is given by: $$ f_{q}(v)=B_{q}\\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_{B}T}\\right)^{3/2}\\left[1-(q-1)\\frac{E}{k_{B}T}\\right]^{1/q-1} $$ Where \\( B_{q} \\) is a normalization constant determined from the requirement \\( \\int f_{q}(v_{i})dv_{i}=1 \\) and is given by: $$ B_{q}=(q-1)^{1/2}\\left(\\frac{3q-1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1+q}{2}\\right)\\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{q-1})}{\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{q-1})}\\left[\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_{B}T}\\right]^{3/2} $$\nYou can also construct the q-Deformed Planck Distribution equation for photon-induced reactions. Now, you calculate the abundances with this new distribution using the same steps with standard maxwell distribution.\nFor a charged particle reaction: \\(1+2\\rightarrow3+4\\), the reaction rate is given by: $$r_{12}=N_{1}N_{2}\\left\u0026lt; \\sigma(v) v\\right\u0026gt;$$ Where v is the relative velocity of the particles 1 and 2, \\(N_{1}\\) and \\(N_{2}\\) are the number of particles of 1 and 2 per unit volume, $\\sigma$ is the cross-section, and \\(\\left\u0026lt; \\sigma v\\right\u0026gt;\\) is the average reaction rate per particle pair. Since the particles will have a velocity distribution, in order to calculate \\( \\left\u0026lt; \\sigma v\\right\u0026gt; \\), we have to integrate it over a velocity distribution. $$\\left\u0026lt; \\sigma v\\right\u0026gt;=\\int f^{rel}(\\boldsymbol{v})v\\sigma(v)dv$$\nThe relation between \\(\\sigma(E)\\) and \\(S(E)\\)is: \\begin{equation} \\sigma(E)=\\frac{1}{E}S(E)e^{-2\\pi\\eta} \\end{equation}\nA detailed derivation is given in Chapter 3 of C. Iliadis. Nuclear Physics of Stars. We can derive \\(f^{rel}_{q}(v)\\) from the \\( f _{q}(v)\\) mentioned before. For the Tsallis distribution, the new rate equation becomes:\n\\begin{equation} \\left\u0026lt; \\sigma v\\right\u0026gt;= \\left( \\frac{8}{\\pi\\mu} \\right)^{1/2}\\frac{1}{(k_{B}T)^{3/2}} \\int e^{-2\\pi\\eta} S(E) f^{rel}_{q}(E)dE \\end{equation}\nUsing the best-fit curves of the S-factor for 12 primary reactions in the reaction network, we calculated the new reaction rates using the non-extensive Tsallis framework. The abundances of light nuclei were calculated using a BBN code, and the impact of this q-parameter and the drawbacks of this model were discussed. By adding a non-extensive parameter (q), the abundances of primordial abundances of light nuclei were in better agreement with the observed values. The predictions can be improved by using a more vast code that includes additional reactions along with their reverse reaction rates, where all the rates are calculated in the Tsallis framework. But even with the limitations of this project, we observed that the abundances of elements like Lithium were better predicted in this non-extensive framework.

Since this was during the pandemic, the intership was conducted online.\nAbstract #\rThe Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method is an approach to the numerical solution of Maxwell’s equations. You discretize both the space and time continua and solve for the electromagnetic fields using boundary conditions through Maxwell\u0026rsquo;s equations. The building block of this discretized FDTD grid is the Yee cell named after Kane Yee who pioneered the FDTD method. With finer discretization, we get more accurate results. But the computational power required increases.\nThis method is useful for many applications. For example, determining the constituents and distribution of materials underground at some spot. This can be done through a ground-penetrating radar (GPR), which is a geophysical method that uses radar pulses to image the subsurface. And GPRMax is a free tool to do the same. It is a computer programme that implements the FDTD method for GPR modelling. Some of its features are: an easy to use command interface, the ability to model dispersive materials, the modelling of complex shaped targets as well as the simulation of unbounded space using powerful absorbing boundary conditions. My intership was on using GPRMax for calculating the sub-surface constituents and distribution of materials in Lunar soil models. You can find more about GPRMax here.\nI learned a lot from this internship. Like the technical stuff about simulations using the FDTD method, the physics of radars and GPRs, using GPR Max. And I also really value the non-technical things I learned from this. This internship coincided with my 7th semester at IITR and I had to really manage my time properly. I successfully balanced the internship, work for my thesis, and got top grades in my college courses. And other things like writing proper and timely reports, being professional, and being punctual with deadlines. Overall, it was a fantastic opportunity because I got to explore computational and engineering-based work at ISRO with a team of highly skilled and knowledgeable scientists.\nResearch Papers and Articles: #\rFa, Wenzhe \u0026amp; Zhu, Meng-Hua \u0026amp; Liu, Tiantian \u0026amp; Plescia, Jeffery.
